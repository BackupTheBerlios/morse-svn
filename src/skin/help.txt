2. Morse code
-------------

2.1 Introduction
----------------

Morse code is a method for transmitting information, using standardized
sequences of short and long marks or pulses - commonly known as "dots"
and "dashes" - for the letters, numerals and special characters of a
message. Originally created for Samuel Morse's electric telegraph in
the mid-1830s, it was also extensively used for early radio communication
beginning in the 1890s. However, with the development of more advanced
communications technologies, the use of Morse code is now largely 
obsolete, although it is still employed for a few specialized purposes,
including navigational radio beacons, and by CW (continuous wave)
amateur radio operators. Morse code is the only digital modulation mode 
designed to be easily read by humans without a computer, making it 
appropriate for sending automated digital data in voice channels.

3. Morse Extension
------------------

3.1 Basic functionality
-----------------------

This extension plays random letters using your soundcard, 
while trying to display the appropriate latin letter as 
background of you current website.

To start playing, use Menu/Tools/Morse/Start.
To stop playing, use Menu/Tools/Morse/Stop.
To view this help, use Menu/Tools/Morse/Help.
To view the license, use Menu/Tools/Morse/License.
To change the morse speed, use Menu/Tools/Morse/Settings.


3.2 Toolbar items
-----------------

This extension also has two toolbar-items. 
To enable/disable those, use Menu/View/Toolbars/Customize.
The two buttons are:

'- -': This stands for the letter 'M' in morse code. 
This toolbar-button contains the same menu as in Tools/Morse,
and though gives you quicker access to Start/Stop learning morse code.

'Morse': This toolbar-item displays the currently played letter
(e.g. 'M --' while your souncard beeps 'dash dash').


4. Known bugs
-------------

- background-displaying of currently playing letters works not on all sites yet 
  (e.g. google and freshmeat.net works while mozilla.org does not .. )

- while playing sounds, the browser behaves a little *blocking*
